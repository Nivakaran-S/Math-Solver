# üßÆ Text to Math Problem Solver & Data Search Assistant

An intelligent AI-powered assistant that interprets natural language math and reasoning problems, performs complex calculations, and fetches relevant factual information from Wikipedia ‚Äî all in one conversational interface.

Built with **Groq‚Äôs Gemma2-9b-It model** and **LangChain**, this project demonstrates my expertise in:

- **Natural Language Understanding**: Parsing and converting everyday language into mathematical expressions.
- **Hybrid Tool Integration**: Seamlessly combining a calculator, reasoning chain, and web search in a single AI agent.
- **Conversational UI Design**: Streamlit-based interactive chat that retains context for smooth multi-turn conversations.
- **Advanced Prompt Engineering**: Tailored prompts that enable detailed, stepwise, and logically structured explanations.

## üöÄ Project Highlights

- **Multifunctional AI Agent**: Combines math problem-solving, logical reasoning, and factual lookup.
- **Stepwise Explanations**: Answers include detailed, pointwise reasoning to enhance understanding.
- **LangChain Agent Framework**: Utilizes Zero-Shot ReAct agent for dynamic tool selection based on the question.
- **Real-time Streaming**: User-friendly responses delivered with progress feedback in Streamlit.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Gracefully manages parsing errors to improve user experience.
